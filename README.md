# to-do-list

25th of May:

In preparation for this project I re-read most of the material starting from constructor functions. I feel like everything is a bit clearer now, and I don;t become dizzy just thinking about constructors, factories, classes, prototypes, Object.assign(), extends, IIFEs, modules and so on. Even tho I'm still not sure what I should actually use. Every article/video handles object creation and inheritance differently.

SOLID principles, on the other hand, definetely elude me. This project would be a piece of cake, if I didn't have to think about patterns and best practices. Now I'm not sure where to even begin.

Maybe I should make my own PubSub module...
